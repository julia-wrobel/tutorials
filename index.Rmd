<br><img src="images/headshot2.png" alt="julia" style="width:30%"><br>


I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics and Informatics](https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/education/departments/biostatistics-informatics/academics) at the [Colorado School of Public Health](https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/), Director of the CU certificate in [Health Analytics and Data Science](https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/education/degrees-and-programs/certificates/certificate-in-health-analytics-and-data-science#ac-optional-specialty-electives-3), and an Associate Editor for [Reproducibility](https://jasa-acs.github.io/repro-guide/) at the [Journal of the American Statistical Association](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/uasa20/current). 

I obtained a BA in chemistry from [Swarthmore College](http://www.swarthmore.edu/) in 2010 and a PhD in biostatistics from [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics) in 2019. My dissertation was advised by [Jeff Goldsmith](http://jeffgoldsmith.com/) and focused on methods for analyzing and visualizing functional data, with applications in wearable devices, structural MRI, and neurobiology.
